# CodePath Open Source Community

Welcome! 👋 This community is **dedicated to fostering collaboration, skill development, and innovation** through open-source projects within the CodePath network. Whether you're looking to contribute, start your own project, or learn from others, this is the place to grow together.

[**CodePath**](https://www.codepath.org/) is on a mission to **reprogram higher education** by creating the most diverse generation of engineers, CTOs, and founders.

**What is Open Source?**  
Open source allows anyone to **use, study, modify, and share** projects freely—made possible through **open-source licenses**. Learn more about open-source principles in [GitHub’s Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/).
